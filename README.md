	//The first one about helloWorld
	
I use Eclipse IDE and JavaScript as coding.
I would like to help and be helped,
to learn more and be helpful.
Thanks to all community and contributions to my learning,
and future projects.

	HELLO_WORLD

I hope to publicize my games that I am developing.
One is like a Zelda clone.
another, adventure with multiple actions:
this one, I will try to draw more attention to the sounds and effects;
For the player to get more experience with the environment and the options.
Focus on the soundtrack.

	The_World is coming
